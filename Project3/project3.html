        <h1>Responsive Design</h1>
        <h2>What is responsive design and why is it important? Responsive design is what allows a website to adjust to different screen sizes.
            It is very important because there are so many different types of devices with different screen sizes that will have access to your 
            website. In order to create a pleasing and consistent experience for your users, responsive design is crucial.
