        <h1>Preprocessing with SASS/LESS</h1>
        <h2>What is preprocessing in CSS? Preprocessing allows you to generate CSS from the preprocessor's own unique syntax. For example with SASS,
            you have the ability to organize your CSS in many different ways that you can't with conventional CSS.

        <h1>Ways to Implement Preprocessing</h1>
        <p>
            <h2>Ways to implement preprocessing:</h2> 
            <ul>
                <li><h2>Server:</h2> <h3>Is used when browsers have all code.</h3></li>

                <li><h2>Client:</h2> <h3>Reduces client-side computation.</h3></li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Mechanisms Used in SASS:</h1>
            <h2>SASS allows for many different ways to organize your style/css. For example, you are able to create variables.
                One important principle in software engineering (and of course with CSS styling as well) is the DRY principle, or 
                'don't repeat yourself'. Variables come in handy when it comes to this principle. The variables allow for you to
                re-use certain style elements. SASS also allows for you to create functions, as well as to 
                nest style elements as an alternative way to organize them. Nesting is one way to produce cleaner code.

            <h4><!-- How I implemented SASS: I downloaded the SASS extension on VSCode.
                This application allows me to create a .scss file and 'watch' the file to 
                convert it into CSS. Every time I make a change to the .scss file, it automatically
                watches it and updates the CSS file. I used variables in my SASS file to make sure the
                code is as dry as possible. I also used nesting to condense the code a bit. --></h4>
