	<h2>How Search Engines Work</h2>
    <p>A search engine allows a user to enter a query and search the internet for websites that have the information they are looking for. Search engines
        use web crawlers to crawl pages and get data.
    </p>

    <h2>The importance of keywords and descriptions as meta tags</h2>
    <p>Keywords and descriptions ensure that the sesarch engines have the information of what your content is about. This whey they will have the ability to display
        the website with the necessary/important results. These are also very helpful if you have a business that you need to advertise, as it helps people to find your website/business. 
    </p>

    <h2>Four elements that comprise writing relevant content links (SEO)</h2>
    <p>
        <h4>The four elements, or pilllars, of wrriting relevant content links include:</h4> 
    <ul>
        <li>How well the content can be crawled, as well as indexed.</li>
        <li>Having the most relevant conent to address question</li>
        <li>Optimization of content and HTML.</li>
        <li>Build authority to ensure search engines lean toward your content over others.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>What constitutes good heading hierarchy </h2>
    <p>A page should start with an h1 heading, then follow with an h2 headindg, and smaller headings under the larger heading. You should have sesctions and
        subsections. They should also be about the same length as your title tags, or less than 70 characters. The headings help to add structure to the website.
